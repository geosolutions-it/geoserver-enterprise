GeoServer ArcSDE Datastore Extension
====================================

This extension adds functionality to GeoServer to allow connection to ArcSDE
instances.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Due to licensing issues, there are certain files that are not distributed
with this archive that are REQUIRED for it to work!

Files required:

1) jsde_sdk.jar (also known as jsde##_sdk.jar where ## is the version number,
   such as 92 for 9.2)
2) jpe_sdk.jar (also known as jpe##_sdk.jar where ## is the version number,
   such as 92 for 9.2)
3) icu4j_3_2.jar (only needed for ArcSDE 9.2 and newer)

These files can be downloaded from ESRI's website or copied from the ArcSDE
installation media.

To download the JSDE/JPE JAR files from ESRI's website:

1) Navigate to:
   http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=downloads.patchesServicePacks.listPatches&PID=66
2) Find the link to the latest service pack for your version of ArcSDE
3) Scroll down to "Installing this Service Pack" -> "ArcSDE SDK" -> "UNIX"
   (regardless of your target OS)
4) Download any of the target files (but be sure to match 32/64 bit to your OS)
5) Open the archive, and extract the JARs.

To download the icu4j JAR file:

1) Navigate to:
   ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/icu4j/3.2/
2) Download the file icu4j_3_2.jar.
