/**
 * The Response interface serves as a common denominator for all service
 * operations that generates content.
 *
 * <p>
 * The work flow for this kind of objects is divided in two parts: the first is
 * executing a request and the second writing the result to an OuputStream.
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Execute: execute(Request)
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Executing the request means taking a Request object and, based on it's set
 * of request parameters, do any heavy processing necessary to produce the
 * response.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Once the execution has been made, the Response object should be ready to
 * send the response content to an output stream with minimal risk of
 * generating an exception.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Anyway, it is not required, even recomended, that the execution process
 * generates the response content itself; just that it performs any query or
 * processing that should generate a trapable error.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Execute may throw a ServiceException if they wish to supply a specific
 * response in error. As an example the WFSTransaction process has a defined
 * Transaction Document with provisions for reporting error information.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * ContentType: getContentType()
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Called to set the response type. Depending on the stratagy used by
 * AbstractService the framework may be commited to returning this type.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Writing: writeTo(OutputStream)
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Write the response to the provided output stream.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Any exceptions thrown by this writeTo method may never reach the end user in
 * useable form. You should assume you are writing directly to the client.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> abort() will be called as part of error handling giving your
 * response subclass a chance to clean up any temporary resources it may have
 * required in execute() for use in writeTo().
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is specially usefull for streamed responses such as wfs GetFeature or
 * WMS GetMap, where the execution process can be used to parse parameters,
 * execute queries upon the corresponding data sources and leave things ready
 * to generate a streamed response when the consumer calls writeTo.
 * </p>
