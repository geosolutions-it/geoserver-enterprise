Services
========

GeoServer serves data using standard protocols established by the `Open Geospatial Consortium <http://www.opengeospatial.org/>`_ (OGC). Web Coverage Service (WCS) allows for requests of coverage data (rasters); Web Feature Service (WFS) allows for requests of geographical feature data (vectors); and Web Map Service (WMS) allows for requests of images generated from geographical data.

This section of the Web Administration Interface allows for the configuration of these services as used by GeoServer.
