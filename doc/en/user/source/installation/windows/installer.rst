.. _installation_windows_installer:Windows Installer=================The Windows installer provides an easy way to set up GeoServer on your system.  With no configuration files to edit or command line setting, everything can be done through the Windows GUI.#. Navigate to the GeoServer Download page at `<http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Download>`_.#. Select the version of GeoServer that you wish to download.  If you're not sure, select the Stable version at `<http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Stable>`_.  #. Click on the link for the Windows installer.   .. figure:: images/win_download.png      :align: center      *Downloading the Windows installer*#. After downloading, double-click on the file to launch.#. At the Welcome screen, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_welcome.png      :align: center      *Welcome screen*#. Read the :ref:`license` and click :guilabel:`I Agree`.   .. figure:: images/win_license.png      :align: center      *GeoServer license*#. Select the directory of the installation, then click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_installdir.png      :align: center      *GeoServer install directory*#. Select the Start Menu directory name and location, then click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_startmenu.png      :align: center      *Start menu location*#. Enter the path to a **valid Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**.  GeoServer requires a valid JRE in order to run, so this step is required.  The installer will inspect your system and attempt to automatically populate this box with the path contained in your ``%JAVA_HOME%`` variable.  If this variable is undefined, you may not have a JRE on your system.  In this case, you can download a JRE at `<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_.  Once the JRE is downloaded and installed, restart the GeoServer installer.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. note:: An example of a valid path would be :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre6`.   .. warning:: Don't include the :file:`\\bin` in the JRE path.  So if :file:`javaw.exe` is located at :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\javaw.exe`, set the path to be :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre6`.   .. note:: Oracle Java SE 6 or newer is strongly recommended.  (As of GeoServer 2.2.x, Oracle JRE 5 is no longer supported.)  A Java Development Kit (JDK) is not required to run GeoServer.  For more information about Java and GeoServer, please see the section on :ref:`production_java`.   .. figure:: images/win_jre.png      :align: center      *Selecting a valid JRE*#. Enter the path to your GeoServer data directory or select the default.  Previous GeoServer users may already have a data directory that they wish to use.  If this is your first time using GeoServer, you should select the :guilabel:`Default data directory`.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_datadir.png      :align: center      *Setting a GeoServer data directory*#. Enter the username and password for administration of GeoServer.  GeoServer's :ref:`web_admin` requires authentication for management, and what is entered here will become those administrator credentials.  The defaults are :guilabel:`admin / geoserver`.  It is recommended to change these from the defaults, but this is not required.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_creds.png      :align: center      *Setting the username and password for GeoServer administration*#. Enter the port that GeoServer will respond on.  This affects the location of the GeoServer :ref:`web_admin`, as well as the endpoints of the GeoServer :ref:`wms` and :ref:`wfs`.  The default port is :guilabel:`8080`, although any valid unused port will work.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_port.png      :align: center      *Setting the GeoServer port*#. Select whether GeoServer should be run manually or installed as a service.  When run manually, GeoServer is run like a standard application under the current user.  When installed as a service, GeoServer in integrated into Windows Services, and thus is easier to administer.  If running on a server, or to manage GeoServer as a service, select :guilabel:`Install as a service`.  Otherwise, select :guilabel:`Run manually`.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_service.png      :align: center      *Installing GeoServer as a service*#. Review your selections and click the :guilabel:`Back` button if any changes need to be made.  Otherwise, click :guilabel:`Install`.   .. figure:: images/win_review.png      :align: center      *Verifying settings*#. GeoServer will install on your system.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Finish` to close the installer.#. If you installed GeoServer as a service, it is already running.  Otherwise, you can start GeoServer by going to the Start Menu, and clicking :guilabel:`Start GeoServer` in the GeoServer folder.#. Navigate to ``http://[SERVER_URL]:[PORT]/geoserver/`` (Ex: ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver/``) to access the GeoServer :ref:`web_admin`.If you see GeoServer in your browser, then congratulations, GeoServer is successfully installed!   .. figure:: images/win_success.png      :align: center      *GeoServer installed and running successfully*
