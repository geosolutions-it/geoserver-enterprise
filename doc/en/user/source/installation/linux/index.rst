GeoServer requires Java to be installed on your system.  Oracle Java SE 6 or newer is strongly recommended. (As of GeoServer 2.2.x, Oracle JRE 5 is no longer supported.) A Java Development Kit (JDK) is not required to run GeoServer.  For more information about Java and GeoServer, please see the section on :ref:`production_java`.

The most common way to install GeoServer is using the OS-independent binary.  This version is a GeoServer web application (webapp) bundled inside `Jetty <http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/>`_, a lightweight servlet container system.  It has the advantages of working very similarly across all operating systems plus being very simple to set up.
