Python Extension Overview
=========================

The python extension provides a number of scripting hooks throughout GeoServer.
These scripting hooks correspond to GeoServer "extension points". An extension
point in GeoServer is a class or interface that is designed to be implemented
and dynamically loaded to provide a specific function. The classic example is
a WMS or WFS output format, but GeoServer contains many extension points.

     Python scripting extension hooks

Implementing a GeoServer extension point in python involves writing scripts and
placing them in the appropriate directory under the GeoServer data directory. 
When the python extension is installed it creates the following directory 
structure::

  GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR/
     ...
     python/
        app/
        datastore/
        filter/
        format/
        lib/
        process/

Each directory correponds to a GeoServer extension point.

The :file:`app` directory consists of python scripts that are intended to be 
invoked over http through a `wsgi <http://wsgi.org/wsgi>`_ interface.

The :file:`datastore` directory consists of python modules that implement the 
geotools data store interface. The geotools data store interface is the 
extension point used to contribute support for vector spatial data formats
from shapefiles to postgis.

The :file:`filter` directory consists of modules that implement filter 
functions. Filter functions are used in WFS queries and in SLD documents.

The :file:`format` directory consists of modules that implement the various 
output format extension points in GeoServer. This includes WMS GetMap, 
GetFeatureInfo and WFS GetFeature. 

The :file:`lib` directory contains common modules that can be used in 
implementing the other types of modules. These types of modules are typically 
utility modules.

The :file:`process` directory consists of modules that implement the geotools 
process interface. Implements of this extension point are used as processes in
the GeoServer WPS.
