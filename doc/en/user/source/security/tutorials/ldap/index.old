Authentication with LDAP
========================

This tutorial introduces GeoServer LDAP support and walks through the process of
setting up authentication agianst an LDAP server. It is recommended that the 
:ref:`sec_auth_provider_ldap` section be read before proceeding.

LDAP server setup
-----------------

A mock LDAP server will be used for this tutorial. Download and run the 
`acme-ldap <http://files.opengeo.org/geoserver/acme-ldap.jar>`_ jar:: 

  java -jar acme-ldap.jar

The output of which should look like the following::

  Directory contents:
    ou=people,dc=acme,dc=org
      uid=bob,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=org
      uid=alice,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=org
      uid=bill,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=org
    ou=groups,dc=acme,dc=org
    cn=users,ou=groups,dc=acme,dc=org
      member: uid=bob,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=org
      member: uid=alice,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=org
    cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=acme,dc=org
      member: uid=bill,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=org

    Server running on port 10389

The following diagram illustrates the hierachy of the LDAP datatabse:

The LDAP tree consists of:

* The root domain component, ``dc=acme,dc=org``
* Two organizational units (groups) named ``user`` and ``admin``
* Two users named ``bob`` and ``alice`` who are members of the ``user`` group
* One user named ``bill`` who is a member of the ``admin`` group

Configure the LDAP authentication provider
------------------------------------------

#. Start GeoServer and login to the web admin interface as the ``admin`` user.
#. Click the ``Authentication`` link located under the ``Security`` section of
   the navigation sidebar.

    .. figure:: images/ldap1.jpg
       :align: center

#. Scroll down to the ``Authentication Providers`` panel and click the ``Add new`` link.

    .. figure:: images/ldap2.jpg
       :align: center

#. Click the ``LDAP`` link.

    .. figure:: images/ldap3.jpg
       :align: center

#. Fill in the fields of the settings form as follows:

   * Set ``Name`` to "acme-ldap"
   * Set ``Server URL``  to "ldap://localhost:10389/dc=acme,dc=org"
   * Set ``User lookup pattern`` to "uid={0},ou=people"
   
#. Test the LDAP connection by entering the username "bob" and password "secret"
   in the connection test form located on the right and click the 
   ``Test Connection`` button. 

   .. figure:: images/ldap4.jpg
      :align: center

   A successful connection should be reported at the top of the page.

#. Save.
#. Back on the authentication page scroll down to the ``Provider Chain`` panel 
   and move the ``acme-ldap`` provider from ``Available`` to ``Selected``.

   .. figure:: images/ldap5.jpg
      :align: center

#. Save.

Test a LDAP login
-----------------

#. Navigate to the GeoServer home page and log out of the admin account. 
#. Login as the user "bob" with the with the password "secret".

   .. figure:: images/ldap6.jpg
      :align: center

Logging in as bob doesn't yield any administrative functionality because the bobaccount has not been mapped to the administrator role. In the next section 
GeoServer will be configured to map groups from the LDAP database to roles. 

Map LDAP groups to GeoServer roles
----------------------------------

When using LDAP for authentication GeoServer maps LDAP groups to GeoServer roles
by prefixing the group name with ``ROLE_`` and converting the result to 
uppercase. For example bob and alice are members of the ``user`` group so after 
authentication they would be assigned a role named ``ROLE_USER``. Similarily 
bill is a member of the ``admin`` group so he would be assigned a role named 
``ROLE_ADMIN``. 

#. Log out of the web admin and log back in as the admin user.
#. Navigate to the ``Authentication`` page.
#. Scroll to the ``Authentication Providers`` panel and click the ``acme-ldap``
   link.

   .. figure:: images/ldap7.jpg
      :align: center

#. On the settings page fill in the following form fields:

   * Set ``Group search base`` to "ou=groups"
   * Set ``Group search filter`` to "member={0}"

   The first field specifies the node of the LDAP directory tree at which groups
   are located. In this case the organizational unit named ``groups``. The 
   second field specifies the LDAP query filter to use in order to locate those
   groups that a specific user is a member of. The ``{0}`` is a placeholder 
   which is replaced with the ``uid`` of the user.

#. Save.

At this point the LDAP provider will populate an authenticated user with roles 
based on the groups the user is a member of. But the GeoServer administrative 
role is named ``ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR``. Therefore even bill who is assigned the 
role ``ROLE_ADMIN`` will not be granted administrative rights. To remedy this 
the GeoServer role service will be reconfigured to treat ``ROLE_ADMIN`` as an 
adminstrative role. 

#. Click the ``Users,Group,Roles`` link located under the ``Security`` section 
   of the navigation sidebar.

   .. figure:: images/ldap8.jpg
      :align: center

#. Scroll to the ``Role Services`` panel and click the ``default`` link.

   .. figure:: images/ldap9.jpg
      :align: center

#. Switch to the ``Roles`` tab. 
#. Add a new role named ``ROLE_ADMIN``.
#. Save.

   .. figure:: images/ldap10.jpg
      :align: center

   .. figure:: images/ldap11.jpg
      :align: center

#. Switch to the ``Settings`` tab.
#. Select ``ROLE_ADMIN`` from the ``Administrator role`` drop down.
   
   .. figure:: images/ldap12.jpg
      :align: center

#. Save.

At this point members of the ``admin`` LDAP group should be given full 
administrative privileges once authenticated. Log out of the admin account and
log in as "bill" with the password "hello". Once logged in full administrative
functionality should be available.
