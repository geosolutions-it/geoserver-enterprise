Security
========

This section details the security subsystem in GeoServer, which is based on `Spring Security <http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/>`_. For web-based configuration, please see the section on :ref:`webadmin_security` in the :ref:`web_admin`.

As of GeoServer 2.2.0, the security subsystem has been completely re-engineered, providing a more secure and flexible authentication framework. This rework is largely based on a Christian MÃ¼eller's 
masters thesis entitled `Flexible Authentication for Stateless Web Services <http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Flexible+Authentication+for+Stateless+Web+Services>`_. It is good reading to help understanding many of the new concepts introduced.
