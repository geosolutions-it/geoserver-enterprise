Data
====


This section is the largest and perhaps the most important section of the Web Administration Interface. Each subsection links directly to a data type page with add, edit, and delete capabilities.

In the example below, the data view page displays a table of indexed data. 

.. figure:: ../images/data_layers.png
   :align: center

   *Layers page*
   
To sort a data type alphabetically, click the column header. 

.. figure:: ../images/data_sort.png
   :align: center

   *Unsorted (left) and sorted (right) columns*

For simple searching of data type contents, enter the search criteria in the search box and click Enter. GeoServer will search the data types that are relevant to your query, and return a Search Results page.

.. figure:: ../images/data_search_results.png
   :align: center
   
   *Search results for the query "top"*

Specific details for adding, editing and deleting various data types are discussed in the following sections.
