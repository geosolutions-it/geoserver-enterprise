Services
========

GeoServer serves data using protocols established by the `Open Geospatial Consortium <http://www.opengeospatial.org/>`_ (OGC). Web Coverage Service (WCS) supports requests for coverage data (rasters), Web Feature Service (WFS) supports requests of geographical feature data (vectors), and Web Map Service (WMS) allows for requests of images generated from geographical data.

This section of the Web Administration Interface describes how to configure these services for GeoServer.
