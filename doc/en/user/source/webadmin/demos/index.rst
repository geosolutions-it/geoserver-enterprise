SRS
---

GeoServer natively supports almost 4,000 Spatial Referencing Systems (SRS), also known as **projections**, and more can be added. A spatial reference system defines an ellipsoid, a datum using that ellipsoid, and either a geocentric, geographic or projection coordinate system. This page lists all SRS info known to GeoServer.

   *Listing of all Spatial Referencing Systems (SRS) known to GeoServer*
   
The :guilabel:`Code` column refers to the unique integer identifier defined by the author of that spatial reference system. Each code is linked to a more detailed description page, accessed by clicking on that code.

   *Details for SRS EPSG:2000*


The title of each SRS is composed of the author name and the unique integer identifier (code) defined by the Author. In the above example, the author is the `European Petroleum Survey Group <http://www.epsg.org/>`_ (EPSG) and the Code is 2000. The fields are as follows:

:guilabel:`Description`—A short text description of the SRS

:guilabel:`WKT`—A string describing the SRS. WKT stands for "Well Known Text"

:guilabel:`Area of Validity`—The bounding box for the SRS
