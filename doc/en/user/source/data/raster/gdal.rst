GDAL Image Formats
==================

GeoServer can leverage the `ImageI/O-Ext <http://java.net/projects/imageio-ext/>`_ GDAL libraries to read selected coverage formats. `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org>`_ is able to read many formats, but for the moment GeoServer supports only a few general interest formats and those that can be legally redistributed and operated in an open source server.

The following image formats can be read by GeoServer using GDAL:

* DTED, Military Elevation Data (.dt0, .dt1, .dt2): http://www.gdal.org/frmt_dted.html
* EHdr, ESRI .hdr Labelled: <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_various.html#EHdr>
* ENVI, ENVI .hdr Labelled Raster: <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_various.html#ENVI>
* HFA, Erdas Imagine (.img): <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_hfa.html>
* JP2MrSID, JPEG2000 (.jp2, .j2k): <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_jp2mrsid.html>
* MrSID, Multi-resolution Seamless Image Database: <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_mrsid.html>
* NITF: <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_nitf.html>
* ECW, ERDAS Compressed Wavelets (.ecw): <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_ecw.html>
* JP2ECW, JPEG2000 (.jp2, .j2k): http://www.gdal.org/frmt_jp2ecw.html
* AIG, Arc/Info Binary Grid: <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_various.html#AIG>
* JP2KAK, JPEG2000 (.jp2, .j2k): <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_jp2kak.html>

Installing GDAL extension
-------------------------

From GeoServer version 2.2.x, GDAL must be installed as an extension. To install it:

#. Navigate to the `GeoServer download page <http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Download>`_

#. Find the page that matches the version of the running GeoServer.

   .. warning::  Be sure to match the version of the extension with that of GeoServer, otherwise errors will occur.

#. Download the GDAL extension.  The download link for :guilabel:`GDAL` will be in the :guilabel:`Extensions` section under :guilabel:`Coverage Store`.

#. Extract the files in this archive to the :file:`WEB-INF/lib` directory of your GeoServer installation.

Moreover, in order for GeoServer to leverage these libraries, the GDAL (binary) libraries must be installed through your host system's OS.  Once they are installed, GeoServer will be able to recognize GDAL data types. See bloe for more information.

Installing GDAL native libraries
````````````````````````````````
The ImageIO-Ext GDAL plugin for geoserver master uses ImageIO-Ext 1.1.7 whose artifacts can be downloaded from `here <http://demo.geo-solutions.it/share/github/imageio-ext/releases/1.1.X/1.1.7/>`_.

Browse to the native and then gdal directory for the `link <http://demo.geo-solutions.it/share/github/imageio-ext/releases/1.1.X/1.1.7/>`_. Now you should see a list of artifacts that can be downloaded. We need to download two things now:

  #. The CRS definitions
  #. The native libraries matching the target operating system
  
Let's now install the CRS definitions.

* Click on the "gdal_data.zip" to download the CRS definitions archive.
* Extract this archive on disk and place it in a proper directory on your system.
* Create a GDAL_DATA environment variable to the folder where you have extracted this file. Make also sure that this directory is reachable and readable by the application server process's user.

We now have to install the native libraries.

* Assuming you are on a 64 bits Ubuntu 11 Linux Operating System (as an instance), click on the linux folder and then on "gdal192-Ubuntu11-gcc4.5.2-x86_64.tar.gz" to download the native libraries archive (Before doing this, make sure to read and agree with the ECWEULA if you intend to use ECW).
* Extract the archive on disk and place it in a proper directory on your system.

   .. warning:: If you are on Windows, make sure that the GDAL DLL files are on your PATH. If you are on Linux, be sure to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to refer to the folder where the SOs are extracted.

   .. note:: The native libraries contains the GDAL GDALinfo utility which can be used to test whether or not the libs are corrupted. This can be done by browsing to the directory where the libs have been extracted and performing a *gdalinfo* command with the *formats* options that shows all the formats supported.

Once these steps have been completed, restart GeoServer.  If all the steps have been performed  correctly, new data formats will be in the :guilabel:`Raster Data Sources` list when creating a new data store as shown here below.

If instead now new formats appear in the GUI and in the logs the following messages is shown:

*it.geosolutions.imageio.gdalframework.GDALUtilities loadGDAL
WARNING: Native library load failed.java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no gdaljni in java.library.path*

that means that the installations failed for some reason.
   
Note on running GeoServer as a Service on Windows
-------------------------------------------------
Simply deploying the GDAL ImageI/O-Ext native libraries in a location referred by the PATH environment variable (like, as an instance, the JDK/bin folder) doesn't allow GeoServer to leverage on GDAL, when run as a service. As a result, during the service startup, GeoServer log reports this worrysome message:

*it.geosolutions.imageio.gdalframework.GDALUtilities loadGDAL
WARNING: Native library load failed.java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no gdaljni in java.library.path*

Taking a look at the wrapper.conf configuration file available inside the GeoServer installation (at bin/wrapper/wrapper.conf), there is this useful entry:

# Java Library Path (location of Wrapper.DLL or libwrapper.so)
wrapper.java.library.path.1=bin/wrapper/lib

To allow the GDAL native DLLs getting loaded, you have 2 possible ways:

#. Move the native DLLs on the referred path (bin/wrapper/lib)
#. Add a wrapper.java.library.path.2=path/where/you/deployed/nativelibs entry just after the wrapper.java.library.path1=bin/wrapper/lib line.
