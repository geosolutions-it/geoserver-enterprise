Working with Vector Data
========================

This section discusses the vector data sources that GeoServer can access.

The standard GeoServer installation supports the loading and serving of the following data formats:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   shapefile
   directory
   properties


Other data sources are supplied as GeoServer extensions.  
Extensions are downloadable modules that add functionality to GeoServer.  
Extensions are available at the `GeoServer download page <http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Download>`_.

.. warning:: The extension version must match the version of the GeoServer instance.
