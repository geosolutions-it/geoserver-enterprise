SLD Reference
=============

In SLD documents **rules**  and **filters** are used to determine sets of features to be styled with particular symbology.
Rules may also specify the scale range in which the feature styling is visible.

Rules contain **symbolizers** to specify how features are styled.  
There are 5 types of symbolizers:  

* ``PointSymbolizer``, which styles features as **points**
* ``LineSymbolizer``, which styles features as **lines**
* ``PolygonSymbolizer``, which styles features as **polygons**
* ``TextSymbolizer``, which styles **text labels** for features
* ``RasterSymbolizer``, which styles **raster coverages**

Each symbolizer type has options and parameters to control styling.
