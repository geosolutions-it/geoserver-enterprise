Code Review
===========

Reviewing code is an invaluble process that is used to ensure that the highest
quality code possible gets comitted into GeoServer at all times. There is no 
hard policy relating to code review such that every line of code needs to be 
reviewed but the unofficial practice which has been adopted over time by 
GeoServer developers is summed up as follows:

* if the change is to a core module and the developer does not have core 
  commit access it requires review
* if the change is non-trivial and to a core module, it should be reviewed
* if the change is local to a module the developer maintains it usually does 
  not require a review

The above guidelines are not rules. In general code review is always welcome and
if there is a question as to if a change should be reviewed or not, always heir
on the side of getting it reviewed.
