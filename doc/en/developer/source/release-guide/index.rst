Release Guide
=============

This guide details the process of performing a GeoServer release.   

Before you start
----------------

GeoTools release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For any non-beta release (including release candidates) a GeoServer release requires a corresponding GeoTools release. Therefore before you start you should coordinate a GeoTools release. Either performing the release yourself or asking on the GeoTools devel list for a volunteer to perform the release.

TODO: point to geotools release docs

Notify developer list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is good practice to notify the `GeoServer developer list <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geoserver-devel>`_ of the intention to make the release a few days in advance, even though the release date has been agreed upon before hand. 

Prerequisites
-------------

The following are necessary to perform a GeoServer release:

#. Commit access to the GeoServer `Git repository <https://Github.com/geoserver/geoserver>`_
#. Build access to `Hudson <http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson>`_
#. Edit access to the GeoServer `Blog <http://blog.geoserver.org>`_
#. Administration rights to GeoServer `JIRA <https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS>`__
#. Release/file management privileges in `SourceForge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/>`_

Versions and revisions
----------------------

When performing a release we don't require a "code freeze" in which no developers can commit to the repository. Instead we release from a revision that is known to pass all tests, including unit/integration tests as well as CITE tests.

To obtain the GeoServer and Geotools revisions that have passed the `CITE test <http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/view/cite/>`_, navigate to the latest Hudson run of the CITE test  and view it's console output and select to view its full log. For example::
  
   http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/view/cite/job/cite-wfs-1.1/813/consoleFull
  
Perform a search on the log for 'Git revision' and you should obtain the following.::

  version = 8-ENTERPRISE-SNAPSHOT
  Git revision = 4ea8d3fdcdbb130892a03f27ab086068b95a3b01
  Git branch = 4ea8d3fdcdbb130892a03f27ab086068b95a3b01
  build date = 03-Aug-2012 03:39
  geotools version = 8-SNAPSHOT
  geotools revision = 73e8d0746a4527e46a46e5e8bc778ca92ca89130
  
Since we don't make any release from master, ensure you select the right CITE test that passed to obtain the right revision.  

Since most GeoServer releases require an official GeoTools release the GeoTools revision is usually not needed. But if performing a beta release it is
allowed to release directly from a specific GeoTools revision. 

Release in JIRA
---------------

Run the `geoserver-release-jira <http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/job/geoserver-release-jira/>`_ job in Hudson. The job takes the following parameters:

**VERSION**

  The version to release, same as in the previous section. This version must match a version in JIRA.

**NEXT_VERSION**

  The next version in the series. All unresolved issues currently fils against ``VERSION`` will be transitioned to this version.

**JIRA_USER** 

  A JIRA user name that has release privileges. This user  will be used to perform the release in JIRA, via the SOAP api.

**JIRA_PASSWD**

  The password for the ``JIRA_USER``.
     
This job will perform the tasks in JIRA to release ``VERSION``. Navigate to `JIRA <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS>`_ and verify that the version has actually been released.

Build the Release
-----------------

Run the `geoserver-release <http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/job/geoserver-release/>`_ job in Hudson. The job takes the following parameters:

**BRANCH**

  The branch to release from, "2.2.x", "2.1.x", etc... This must be a stable branch. Releases are not performed from master.
     
**REV**

  The Git revision number to release from. eg, "24ae10fe662c....". If left blank the latest revision (ie HEAD) on the ``BRANCH`` being released is used.
  
**VERSION**
   
  The version/name of the release to build, "2.1.4", "2.2", etc...
  
**GT_VERSION**

  The GeoTools version to include in the release. This may be specified as a version number such as "8.0" or "2.7.5". Alternatively the version may be specified as a Git branch/revision pair in the form ``<branch>@<revision>``. For example "master@36ba65jg53.....". Finally this value may be left blank in which the version currently declared in the geoserver pom will be used (usually a SNAPSHOT). Again if performing a non-beta release this version must be a version number corresponding to an official GeoTools release. 
  
**GWC_VERSION**
  
  The GeoWebCache version to include in the release. This may be specified as a version number such as "1.3-RC3". Alternatively the version may be specified as a Git revision of the form ``<branch>@<revision>`` such as "master@1b3243jb...". Finally this value may be left blank in which the version currently declared in the geoserver pom will be used (usually a SNAPSHOT).Git Again if performing a non-beta release this version must be a version number corresponding to an official GeoTools release. 

**GIT_USER**

  The Git username to use for the release.

**GIT_EMAIL**

  The Git email to use for the release.  
     
This job will checkout the specified branch/revision and build the GeoServer
release artifacts against the GeoTools/GeoWebCache versions specified. When 
successfully complete all release artifacts will be uploaded to the following
location::

   http://gridlock.opengeo.org/geoserver/release/<RELEASE> 
   
Additionally when the job completes it fires off two jobs for building the 
Windows and OSX installers. These jobs run on different hudson instances. 
When those jobs complete the ``.exe`` and ``.dmg`` artifacts will be uploaded
to the location referenced above.

Test the Artifacts
------------------

Download and try out some of the artifacts from the above location and do a 
quick smoke test that there are no issues. Engage other developers to help 
test on the developer list.
 
Publish the Release
-------------------

Run the `geoserver-release-publish <http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/job/geoserver-release-publish/>`_ in Hudson. The job takes the following parameters:

**VERSION** 

  The version being released. The same value s specified for ``VERSION`` when running the ``geoserver-release`` job.
  
**BRANCH** 

  The branch being released from.  The same value specified for ``BRANCH`` when running the ``geoserver-release`` job.

This job will rsync all the artifacts located at::

     http://gridlock.opengeo.org/geoserver/release/<RELEASE>

to the SourceForge FRS server. Navigate to `Sourceforge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/>`__ and verify that the artifacts have been uploaded properly. Set the necessary flags on the ``.exe``, ``.dmg`` and ``.bin`` artifacts so that they show up as the appropriate default for users downloading on the Windows, OSX, and Linux platforms.

Create the download page
------------------------

Get the JIRA version for this release:

* Go to `JIRA <http://jira.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/>`_
* Select "Change log"
* Open the release notes for the version being released
* The version will be in the url, e.g. ``http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10311&version=18700`` -> 18700

Create the new download page:

* Go to `GeoServer web site <http://geoserver.org/>`_ and make sure you are logged in.
* Select the "New page" link in the menu
* Click "select a page template to start from"
* Choose the "Download" template
* Fill in the version, release date (e.g., May 17th, 2012) and the jira version
* Set the page title to the version being released (e.g. "GeoServer 2.2-RC3")
* Save and check all the links are working

If you are releasing a stable version, edit the `Stable version <http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Stable>`_ page and make it include the newly created release page.
If you are instead releasing a beta/RC, edit the `Latest version <http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Latest>`_ page and make it include the newly created release page.
